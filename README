              [[[  FreeJ 0.10 "set the vj free"  ]]]

:: OVERVIEW

FreeJ  is a  vision mixer:  a  digital instrument  for realtime  video
manipulation used  in the fields  of dance teather,  veejaying, online
streaming, medical visualisation and TV.

It runs a  video engine in which multiple layers  can be filtered thru
effect  chains  and then  mixed  together  with  images, movies,  live
cameras, particle generators, text scrollers and vector graphics.  All
the resulting video mix can be shown on a screen, encoded into a movie
and streamed live to the internet.

FreeJ can be controlled locally or remotely, also from multiple places
at the same time, using its ascii console interface; operations can be
scripted in  javascript and triggered  live via keyboard,  mouse, MIDI
controllers,  Joysticks,  OSC  clients,  Wiimotes and more devices.

 FreeJ's sourcecode is  written in portable C and C++  and it works on
most platforms  supported by the  GNU C compiler, including  32bit and
64bit processors, PowerPC and various ARM flavours.

FreeJ is released free under the GNU General Public License (v3).

   webcams, TV, divx/avi movies, images, txt files and more
++ can encode in Ogg/Theora video, recording on local file
   and streaming live to an online Icecast server
++ can be controlled from remote: VJoE - VeeJay over Ethernet
++ can be scripted in object oriented javascript
++ supports frei0r and freeframe video plugins
++ very efficient video engine with multithreaded layers
++ Emacs/Vi style console with hotkeys and completion
++ multiple controllers at the same time (Midi,Joystick etc.)
++ 100% Free and open source, GCC 4 compliant portable code 




:: HISTORY

This software started being  developed as a digital instrument Jaromil
used  in dance-theater  performances. Since  2001  ongoing development
took  inspiration  from   various  artists  and  programmers:  Andreas
Schiffler,  Roberto Paci Dalo',  Tom Demeyer,  Francescopaolo Isidoro,
Kentaro Fukuchi,  Luigi Pagliarini, Isabella  Bordoni, to name  just a
few.

Set the VeeJay Free! was the first motto for this software.

In 2003 Kysucix joined  development contributing the streaming feature
and helping  to include  the javascript parser.  He employed  FreeJ in
interactive installations while working with Studio Azzurro.

Since 2004 Jaromil has been employed by Montevideo / Time Based Arts 
(NIMK) and his research and development activity also converged in
FreeJ development.

In 2005 Mr.Goil  joined development, writing programmable controllers,
reviewing the scripting environment and adding more features.

In 2007  the austrian initiative Netculture.lab  supported Jaromil and
Mr.Goil  developing the  BeTV release:  it enhanced  scriptability and
streaming, with a major cleanup of the code and wider support of video
plugins.

After revamping their enthusiasm in the Chaos Computer Camp, in 2008
  both Jaromil  and  Mr.Goil  met regularly  in  code
sessions ,  rapidly driving  the project towards a  stable  javascript API.
 Meanwhile Blender2Crystal developer Caedes has joined implementing
 python bindings and using the FreeJ engine in a 3d environment.

In 2009 FreeJ development is sponsored by Digitale Pioneers and  almost  the entire  team  had  the  opportunity  to join the
Wintercamp organised by the Institute of Network Cultures in Amsterdam;
 here, a week of coding & sharing gave a significant push to the entire project, leading to many bug fixes and
some really interesting rewriting and optimization into the code.
Those magical days saw the presence of Vlax from Oaxaca, Jaromil,
Acracia, Xant and V@nex, Kobaiashi, Crash, Tomak, Shammash
and Asbesto, Mr.Goil, Andy, Adnan, Lluis and Rama. What a nice family! :)

For the time  being, FreeJ is employed in  various video performances,
interactive  installations and  online TV  streams, as  well  used for
visualisations in medical analysis.

Developers are  keen to accept  projects and propositions in  order to
sustain the  development activity and involve  more developers, please
join our  mailinglist on  http://lists.dyne.org to collaborate  and be
part of our history :)





:: GET STARTED

To start rolling with FreeJ you can have a look to the online
documentation on http://freej.dyne.org

Most  powerful uses of  FreeJ involve  scripting for  live interaction
with devices and video compositing,  still a first look at the console
controller can give an initial picture of how the software works.

A nice tutorial to start is: http://lab.dyne.org/FreejTutorial 

Tutorials,  examples and  scripting reference  are available  from the
website as well along with the distributed sourcecode, in the doc/ and
scripts/ directories. GNU/Linux distributions usually ship these files
inside /usr/share/freej and /usr/doc/FreeJ*

As development  unrolls suggestions and feedback are  welcome, join us
on the freej mailinglist on http://lists.dyne.org and let us know your
impressions and ideas.



:: REQUIREMENTS

To compile and run FreeJ it is necessary to have:

- a working GNU/Linux system
  or Darwin/OSX -> see the documentation in README.OSX 

- SDL libraries http://www.libsdl.org
- PNG libraries http://www.libpng.org
- S-LANG libraries http://www.s-lang.org

Several  other  libraries are  optional  and  strongly recommended  to
benefit  from  all  features   implemented  in  FreeJ,  in  particular
Ogg/Vorbis/Theora libraries available on http://www.xiph.org




:: HOW TO INSTALL IT

  ++ GNU/Linux users:

     On  Debian  and  Ubuntu  'freej'  stable packages  are  ready  to
     install. Release  candidates up  to date with  latest development
     are also published on: http://launchpad.org/~jaromil/+archive

     On Gentoo it is also possible to 'emerge freej'

  ++ Apple/OSX users:

     Binary packages  of FreeJ  for OSX should  be available  from the
     website  http://freej.dyne.org,  although  they  might be  a  bit
     outdated and limited in features.  It is also possible to compile
     FreeJ  from  source following  the  README.OSX  and using  XCode,
     MacPorts and Fink.

     In case you are a programmer talented with OSX please consider to
     get in touch with us  and contribute to make this software better
     on the Apple platform, there isn't much work to do anyway.

  ++ Windlows users:

     No-one of us feels to compile FreeJ on the M$ platform, but there
     is a quick and easy way to try this software using the dyne:bolic
     liveCD  even  without installing  anything,  just  boot it,  see:
     http://dynebolic.org

  ++ Game console users:

     Experimental builds  of FreeJ have succeeded to  work on consoles
     as GP2X and NintendoDS. It  should be also possible to make FreeJ
     run on other embedded devices and we are very interested in doing
     so, please contact us if you are as well :)
