               :: set the vj free ::
 free unified framework for realtime video processing

:: OVERVIEW

FreeJ aims to be a digital instrument for  video  livesets,  featuring
realtime rendering of multilayered video and chained effect  filtering
directly on the screen.  FreeJ threats every video source as a  layer,
making then possible to dynamically apply on each a chain of  filters,
loadable as effect plugins and easily customizable. Layers are planned
for rendering of  analog  video  input,  digital  movie  files,  image
bitmaps, sound scopes, texts and eventually more.

FreeJ is being developed in the hope to provide the GNU community with
a free, modular and highly customizable application to  perform  video
livesets, based on a GPL'ed framework that lets anybody implement  his
own filters concentrating simply on the dsp  algorithm  developed  and
furthermore to combine them over any supported layer.

FreeJ is Free Software and his sourcecode is released  under  the  Gnu
Public License, it comes with  absolutely  no  warranty  and  you  are
welcome to redistribute it under  certain  conditions  (refer  to  the
license for details).

:: FEATURES

++ multilayered video engine
++ filters loaded as runtime DSO plugins
++ layer filtering thru chainable dsp algorithms
++ MMX/SSE accelerated engine lubrification
++ efficient triple-buffered video grabbing layer
++ modular c++ code structure
++ multithreaded architecture (POSIX.1b compliant)
++ (ab)user friendly OnScreenDisplay interface

:: REQUIREMENTS

To run FreeJ is necessary to have:

- a working GNU/Linux workstation with a MMX capable CPU
- SDL libraries <http://www.libsdl.org>
- NASM <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/nasm>
- XFree86 4.2 or latest, better with an accelerated videocard
- a video4linux supported grabbing card

For better fullscreen support try to add to your XF86Config  file  the
modelines in doc/x11.modelines.

:: INSTALL

Make sure you have all the required software, then just do: 

 ./configure
 make
 make install

filter plugins will be installed into /usr/local/lib/freej (or another
prefix if you changed the default one).

For better fullscreen support you might want to add in your XF86Config
file the modelines included into doc/x11.modelines.

:: DISCUSSION

A mailinglist  for  further  discussion  about  FreeJ  is  running  as
<freej@dyne.org>, subscription is opened and  anybody  interested  can
send a mail to <freej-subscribe@dyne.org> to join. Online archive and
mailinglist interface is made available on
[http://dyne.org/cgi-bin/ml.cgi?4] .

:: AVAILABILITY

Updated informations and FreeJ releases are made available on
[http://freej.dyne.org]. The bleeding edge sourcecode is also publicly
available thru CVS on [http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freej]  (there
you will find instructions on how to get and browse online the  code).
