Description: realtime video mixer and linear video editor
 FreeJ is a digital instrument for realtime video manipulation used in
 the fields of dance theater, veejaying, medical visualization and TV.
 FreeJ lets you interact with multiple layers of video (images, movies,
 live cameras, particle generators, text scrollers, flash animations and
 more), filter them with effect chains and then mix them together. It can
 be operated live from a text console and scripted to be controlled by
 keyboard, midi, OSC and joysticks.
