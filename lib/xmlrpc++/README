  XmlRpc++ Library

   This is version 0.7 of XmlRpc++, an implementation of the [1]XmlRpc
   protocol written in C++, based upon Shilad Sen's excellent
   [2]py-xmlrpc library. XmlRpc++ is designed to make it easy to
   incorporate XmlRpc client and server support into C++ applications. Or
   use both client and server objects in your app for easy peer-to-peer
   support.

  Features

     * Easy   This library is easy to incorporate into C++ applications.
       No other libraries are required, other than your system's socket
       libraries. Simple XML parsing and HTTP support are built in.
     * Fast   All IO is non-blocking, so a slow client or network will
       not slow down the server.
     * Portable Written in standard C++ to the POSIX and Windows sockets
       APIs. You do need a fairly recent compiler (g++ 3.1 or MSVC++ .Net
       or MSVC++ 6 with the [3]STL patches.)
     * Free   This library is released under the [4]GNU [5]LGPL.


  Changes

     * Better handling of fault responses: server methods can throw an
       XmlRpcException to return a fault and XmlRpcClient has a new
       method to test whether the last response was a fault.
     * Support for system.listMethods and system.methodHelp from the
       introspection API.
     * Support for system.multicall to process multiple requests in a
       single transaction.
     * Fixed a problem in the XmlRpcServer destructor (it should not have
       been deleting the methods).
     * The server ensures a valid result value is returned even if the
       method does not set the result. The default result is an empty
       string.
     * Doxygen comments in header files and a doc target in the makefile.


  Installation

   There are VC++ 6 and VC++ .Net project files building on Windows. If
   you are using VC++ 6, you should apply SP3 and the fixes at
   [6]http://www.dinkumware.com/vc_fixes.html. Be sure to set the
   appropriate code generation switches. In particular, ensure that the
   runtime library (single/multi-threaded, static library/DLL) used is
   the same for the XmlRpc++ code and whatever application it will be
   linked to.

   For Linux, Solaris, and other Unix-like platforms there is a GNU
   Makefile which can be edited to suit your system. Specify your C++
   compiler, compiler flags, and your system's socket libraries.

   In the test directory there are various test programs that are built
   by default. To verify that the library built correctly, you can start
   the HelloServer example:
HelloServer 8000

   and the HelloClient example in another terminal window:
HelloClient localhost 8000

   You should see two Hello messages and a sum displayed (amongst a bunch
   of debug output). You can also try the XML server validator program
   (eg, "Validator 80") and then attempt to connect to it from
   [7]http://validator.xmlrpc.com (if you have access to the internet and
   are not behind a firewall etc).

   Although no code was re-used, the design and structure of the library
   is based upon the py-xmlrpc library implementation.
