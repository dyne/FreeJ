FreeJ installation instructions
===================================

*** x86 PC (for Darwin/OSX see README.OSX)


[*] be sure to have all the required libraries and tools:

```
cdbs libtool debhelper pkg-config flex bison libsdl1.2-dev libpng-dev \
libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libjpeg-dev \
libslang2-dev libtheora-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev \
libunicap2-dev libbluetooth-dev libfftw3-dev libjack-dev liblo0-dev \
libasound-dev libshout-dev libsamplerate0-dev libhtml-template-perl \
libcairo2-dev libunicap2-dev libopencv-dev
```

- A working GNU/Linux system with X or framebuffer video

- SDL libraries http://www.libsdl.org

- PNG library (compile with _ZLIB_ support) http://libpng.org

== to have some more assembler mmx optimized filters you need NASM:
   NASM netwide assembler compiler http://sf.net/projects/nasm
   then go in the filters/nasm-x86 and type make!
   copy by hand the *.so filters in a ~/.freej/ directory in your home

[*] then you are ready to compile!

== download freej latest stable version from http://ftp.dyne.org/freej
   extract the source archive and compile it:
   $ tar xvfz freej.tar.gz
   $ cd freej
    (if you are reading this file from the sourcecode, start from here)
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install

   this will install effect plugins into /usr/local/lib/freej/
   the freej binary in /usr/local/bin/
  (or any other prefix you configured instead of the default /usr/local)

   $ freej [enter]

   and you should see.



:: INSTALL FROM DEBIAN PACKAGES

You can do 'apt-get install freej' and you will have a precompiled FreeJ 

Anyway to squeeze the best out of your box you want to compile this
software with machine specific optimizations!

The source configure script guesses the best compiler optimization flags
for your CPU.

the following commands are then necessary to set your build environment,
from inside the freej source directory do:

sudo apt-get install autoconf automake
sudo apt-get build-dep freej
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot



:: INSTALL FROM GIT REPOSITORY
   (only for developers, skilled users, full code alchemists)

Assuming you have Debian/Ubuntu (for other distro there can be some
differences), with all tools needed and all developers lib installed 
(e.g. build-essential, the libs above etc.:

  You need git:
- apt-get install git-core

  So, get the code:
- git clone git://code.dyne.org/freej.git

After this, you will have a "freej" dir. Enter in it, and do 

- ./autogen.sh
- Run "./configure" with your favourite options.
- make && sudo make install 

That's all!



If you want to experiment with live video, please be sure to have a working
camera and to activate it from your BIOS settings (e.g. for eeepc 701), or
it will not work! :)

If you have problems, you are welcome to ask on the mailinglist for
help, there you will probably find some good suggestions

Please try to not mix your system's problems with FreeJ's bugs.

If you find bugs, you are welcome to report them in the bugtracking
system on http://bugs.dyne.org
