FreeJ 0.6 installation instructions
===================================

*** x86 PC (for Darwin/OSX see README.OSX)


[*] be sure to have all the required libraries and tools

- A working GNU/Linux system with X or framebuffer video

- SDL libraries http://www.libsdl.org

[*] check the optional libraries you need for certain features

== to playback movies, install the video libraries in this order:
   FFMpeg library http://ffmpeg.sf.net
   Xvid library http://xvid.org
   AviFile library http://avifile.sourceforge.net

== to play with truetype rendered text install:
   Freetype2 http://freetype.org

== to play with PNG images you need PNG libs with Zlib support:
   PNG library (compile with _ZLIB_ support) http://libpng.org

== to use the javascript interpreter and execute scripted operations
   download SpiderMonkey http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey
   compile it (refer to the documentation inside it)
   then come back to the freej directory and do:
   ./configure --with-javascript=/path/to/js
   (PLEASE NOTE THIS IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL WORK :)

== to have some more assembler mmx optimized filters you need NASM:
   NASM netwide assembler compiler http://sf.net/projects/nasm
   then go in the filters/nasm-x86 and type make!
   copy by hand the *.so filters in a ~/.freej/ directory in your home



[*] then you are ready to compile!

== download freej latest stable version from http://ftp.dyne.org/freej
   extract the source archive and compile it:
   $ tar xvfz freej-0.6.tar.gz
   $ cd freej-0.6
    (if you are reading this file from the sourcecode, start from here)
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install

   this will install effect plugins into /usr/local/lib/freej/
   the freej binary in /usr/local/bin/
  (or any other prefix you configured instead of the default /usr/local)

   $ freej [enter]

   and you should see.



:: INSTALL FROM DEBIAN PACKAGES

You can do 'apt-get install freej' and you will have a precompiled FreeJ 
thanks to Guido Trotter.
Anyway to squeeze the best out of your box you want to compile this
software with machine specific optimizations.
The source configure script guesses the best compiler optimization flags
for your CPU.



If you have problems, you are welcome to ask on the mailinglist for
help, there you will probably find somebody to help you.

Please try to not mix your problems with FreeJ's bugs.

If you find bugs, you are welcome to report them in the bugtracking
system on http://bugs.dyne.org
